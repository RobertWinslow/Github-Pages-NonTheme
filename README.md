# Github Pages NonTheme Template
This is a template for a "themeless" Github Pages repo. Use this if you just want Github to render your markdown into html, but want to provide your own css styling.

---

Github Pages automatically renders markdown files into webpages using Jekyll. By default, there is a very minimal theme that it uses, which looks something like this:


There's some built-in style, and there is a link back to the homepage in the header of each page.

This repo includes some files that override the default Jekyll theme, to reduce it's functionality to the bare minimum.
